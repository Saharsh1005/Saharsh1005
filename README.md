I love to add intelligence to inanimate objects through code. I believe computers are like an extention of our mind and make us super-humans.

I am a proud CS alum of Manipal Institute of Technology. During my tenure as a student, I conducted research with prof. Radhika Kamath and also worked alongside UNSW Sydney transitional-AI group on tackling issues like weed detection and coral reef mapping. I am deeply passionate about leveraging AI to bring societal impact. Let's code for good.
