Hi! 👋 I completed my MS in CS at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ms-program), advised by [Prof. Koustuv Saha](https://koustuv.com/) and was awarded J N Tata Scholarship. My thesis focused on developing a human-in-the-loop framework for stereotype detection in Text-to-Image models, using LLMs as social bias judges.

Currently, delivering computer vision at scale at [Dragonfruit AI](https://www.dragonfruit.ai/). Previously, worked as a ML Engineer at Onward Assist (vision for pathology automation).

I hold a **B.Tech in Computer Science** from Manipal Institute of Technology.

**Areas of focus:** Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Computer Vision, LLMs, Systems

**Grateful to my mentors:**
